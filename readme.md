Fantastic! You've generated all the necessary outputs. The coding and analysis portion of the hackathon is officially complete. Your `final_output_df` is ready, and your analysis of STL provides a powerful story.

You are in the final stage. The only thing left is to package your incredible work into a compelling presentation and prepare your submission files.

### Final Step: Build Your Presentation & Submit üèÜ

Now it's time to be a data storyteller and business strategist. You will use the outputs you just generated to build a narrative for United Airlines.

#### 1. Build Your Presentation (7-8 Slides)

Here is a slide-by-slide guide to creating a high-impact presentation.

- **Slide 1: Title Slide**

  - Title: A Data-Driven Flight Difficulty Score to Enhance Operational Efficiency
  - Your Name

- **Slide 2: Executive Summary (The Elevator Pitch)**

  - **The Problem:** Nearly 50% of flights from ORD depart late, driven by inconsistent, experience-based resource planning.
  - **Our Solution:** We developed a daily Flight Difficulty Score that systematically ranks every flight by its operational complexity.
  - **Key Finding:** The primary drivers of difficulty are extreme ground time pressure and high volumes of transfer baggage, particularly on short-haul routes like St. Louis (STL).
  - **Top Recommendation:** Proactively allocate specialized ground crews and baggage handlers to the top 5% of 'Difficult' flights each day, starting with the STL route.

- **Slide 3: Key Findings from the Data**

  - Use your most powerful EDA numbers.
  - **"Departure Delays are Widespread":** Show the "Average delay: 21.19 minutes" and "49.7% of flights depart late."
  - **"Ground Time is a Critical Bottleneck":** Highlight that "621 flights were scheduled with less than the minimum required turnaround time," putting them at risk before the day even began.
  - **"ORD is a Complex Transfer Hub":** Note the high average ratio of ~3 transfer bags for every checked bag.

- **Slide 4: Our Solution: The Flight Difficulty Score**

  - Briefly explain your model.
  - **Features:** List the features you used (`ground_time_pressure`, `passenger_load_factor`, etc.).
  - **Weighting:** Explain your logic. "We assigned the highest weight (30%) to **Ground Time Pressure** because our EDA revealed it was a significant and direct operational constraint. **Transfer Bag Ratio** received the next highest weight (20%) due to ORD's role as a major hub."

- **Slide 5: Analysis Deep Dive: St. Louis (STL)**

  - This is where you use your latest output!
  - Show the "Top 10 Most Difficult Destinations" list, with STL at the top.
  - Display the comparison table for STL.
  - **The Story:** "Flights to St. Louis are **44% more delayed** than the airport average. Our analysis reveals two clear reasons why: they have **51% less ground time buffer** and handle **50% more transfer bags**."

- **Slide 6: Actionable Recommendations**

  - Turn your STL analysis into concrete actions.
  - **Recommendation 1 (Address Ground Time):** "For the top 5 daily 'Difficult' flights to STL, we recommend pre-assigning an expanded ground crew to guarantee the aircraft is ready for boarding ahead of schedule, directly countering the -51% ground time pressure."
  - **Recommendation 2 (Address Transfer Bags):** "For STL-bound flights, baggage handlers should prioritize sorting transfer bags. Since these flights handle 50% more transfers, this targeted approach will reduce mishandled bags and departure delays waiting on baggage."

- **Slide 7: Conclusion & Business Impact**
  - Summarize the value of your solution.
  - **From Reactive to Proactive:** Your score allows teams to plan for difficulty _before_ it happens.
  - **Data-Driven Decisions:** Replaces guesswork with a consistent, scalable system.
  - **Expected Outcome:** Improved on-time performance, more efficient use of resources, and reduced employee stress.

### 2. Finalize Your Submission Package

You're ready to submit. Just run through this final checklist.

1.  **Presentation:** Save your slides as a PDF.
2.  **CSV File:** You have already created `test_yourname.csv`. Make sure it's named correctly.
3.  **Code:** Clean up your Python notebook. Add comments to explain your steps. Write a simple `README.md` file with instructions if needed.
4.  **Zip Everything:** Combine the PDF, CSV, and code files into a single ZIP folder. Double-check the name and size limits.

Congratulations on completing this challenging hackathon problem from start to finish!
